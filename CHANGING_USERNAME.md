# GitHub Username Change Documentation

## Status: COMPLETED ✅

The repository username has been updated from "tittyyhead" to "rabs" to maintain professionalism.

## Overview
This guide documents how the GitHub username was changed in this repository.

## Changing Your GitHub Username

### Step 1: Change Username on GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/admin
2. Scroll down to "Change username"
3. Enter your new desired username
4. Click "Change username"
5. Confirm the change

### Important Notes:
- GitHub automatically redirects from your old username to your new one
- Existing repositories will be accessible at the new URL
- Git remotes will continue to work due to automatic redirects
- Badge URLs in documentation will need manual updates

## Updating This Repository

After changing your GitHub username, update the following files:

### Files to Update:
1. **README.md** (lines 3-4) - GitHub badge URLs
2. **docs/README.md** (lines 3-4) - GitHub badge URLs

### Update Instructions:

Replace `YOUR_OLD_USERNAME` with your new username in these badge URLs:

```markdown
![GitHub Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/YOUR_NEW_USERNAME/radxa-cubie-a7a-maximum-overclock?style=social)
![GitHub Forks](https://img.shields.io/github/forks/YOUR_NEW_USERNAME/radxa-cubie-a7a-maximum-overclock?style=social)
```

### What Was Changed:
The following files were updated to use the new username "rabs":
- **README.md** - Updated badge URLs (lines 3-4)
- **docs/README.md** - Updated badge URLs (lines 3-4)

All instances of "tittyyhead" in badge URLs have been replaced with "rabs".

## What Gets Updated Automatically:
- Repository URLs (GitHub handles redirects)
- Git remote URLs (redirects work automatically)

## What Needs Manual Update:
- Badge URLs in README files (as shown above)
- Any hardcoded URLs in documentation
- Links in external documentation or websites
